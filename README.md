# Prolog

## Overview
Prolog is an R package that provides with a list of significant genes or proteins through rounds of logistic regression taking into account clinical data as well as the set clinical or disease categories as the outcome variable

## Usage
Prolog asks for two input variables. One of these is the expression dataset consisting of proteins as row headings and sample IDs as column headings. The other input parameter is the clinical parameters dataset consisting of various clinical parameters as column headings alongwith the outcome variable column too





















































## Acknowledgements
The Prolog package was created in association with and with guidance from the Institute of Cancer Research (ICR), UK. The data that helped in constructing and testing the package was provided by ICR too
